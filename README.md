# CrowdFunding
A crowdfunding smart contract using solidity for ethereum network.

## About Project

Our project is a smart contract written in solidity language, used in enthereum networks. The smart contract is a crowdfunding program that generates a contract between the contributer and the reciever. the reciever requests for a specific amount for funding (in ethers) and the contributers contribute a certain amount according to their preferrence. A voting system is held among the contributers where it is decided which reciever will be getting the overall funding, as there can be more than one requests for funding. The request that gets the majority vote will recieve the necessary amount as was requested. If the time limit for the crowdfunding exceeds without reaching the minimum target amount, then the crowdfunding terminates, returning all the collected ethers to the contributers.
